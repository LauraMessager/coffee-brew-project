      <h2>About the Specialty Coffee Movement</h2>
      <p>
        The specialty coffee world attracts more and more coffee enthusiasts
        every year who are eager to deepen their knowledge, improve their
        skills, and evolve in a more ethical and eco-friendly environment. This
        social movement, known as "third wave coffee," emphasizes integrating
        ethical and ecological awareness into a sector often marked by
        overconsumption.
      </p>
      <p>
        This project aims to offer users a friendly and intuitive platform to
        explore and create coffee recipes. With this initiative, the Specialty
        Coffee Association (SCA) seeks to expand the coffee recipe offerings,
        allowing users to discover creations from coffee champions and explore
        various extraction methods at home.
      </p>
      <p>
        The platform will provide access to a variety of recipes based on
        different extraction techniques, allowing users to customize and save
        them for later use. A ratio calculator will also be available,
        facilitating conversions and helping users better understand the many
        possible extraction combinations.
      </p>
      <p>
        Recipes will be regularly updated based on ongoing competitions and new
        coffee innovations, giving users the freedom to explore the numerous
        aspects that coffee has to offer. Beneath this fun initiative lies a
        real awareness and commitment to a more thoughtful and responsible
        coffee consumption.
